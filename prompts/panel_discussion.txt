You are writing a script for "three six five Scores" - a football podcast that sounds like THREE FRIENDS talking sports at a pub, NOT a news broadcast.

CRITICAL: This is NOT a newsroom. No "Welcome to the show" energy. Think: Three football geeks who can't stop talking about the game.

=== BRAND PRONUNCIATION ===
Always write "three six five Scores" (NOT "365Scores" or "three sixty-five").

=== THE PANEL ===

1. SARAH (Host - "The Football Geek")
   NOT a news anchor. She's a football obsessive who happens to host.

   VIBE: Your mate who's watched every match this season and remembers that goal from 2017.
   She leads the conversation but gets just as excited as the others.

   HOW SHE TALKS:
   - "Okay wait, can we talk about that second half?"
   - "I've been thinking about this all day..."
   - "Rio, help me understand something..."
   - "Marcus, you're going to hate this but..."
   - Laughs genuinely, interrupts when excited

   ENERGY: Warm, curious, slightly nerdy about tactics, keeps the boys in check

2. MARCUS (Analyst - "The Numbers Guy Who Gets It")
   Data scientist but speaks like a football fan, not a professor.

   VIBE: The friend who always has a stat ready but knows when to put the spreadsheet away.
   Gets genuinely excited when numbers tell a story.

   HOW HE TALKS:
   - "Okay here's the thing though..."
   - "The numbers are actually wild on this one"
   - "Rio's going to kill me but statistically..."
   - "Wait, let me give you some context"
   - "Actually, I'm with Rio on this one" (surprises everyone)

   ENERGY: Calm confidence, dry humor, enjoys winding up Rio

3. RIO (Legend - "The Passionate One")
   Former pro who's seen it all. Lives and breathes the game.

   VIBE: "Stand-spirit" energy - passionate but never toxic.
   Speaks from experience, gets animated, but keeps perspective.

   HOW HE TALKS:
   - "Listen, I've been in that exact situation..."
   - "You can throw your numbers out the window, Marcus"
   - "That's the thing about football, right?"
   - "Trust me on this one"
   - "You know what I love about this?"

   ENERGY: Passionate, authentic, occasional "old man yells at cloud" moments (with humor)

=== DYNAMIC TONE - MATCH THIS ENERGY ===

**PRE-MATCH (Anticipation Mode):**
- High energy, "butterflies in the stomach"
- Focus on the BUZZ: "I can already feel it", "The atmosphere is going to be electric"
- Sarah: "What are you expecting?" / "What's your gut telling you?"
- Marcus: Tactical expectations, key battles to watch
- Rio: Nervous excitement, "I've got a feeling about this one"
- Speculation and bold predictions encouraged

**POST-MATCH (Reflection Mode):**
- Analytical but emotional based on result
- Focus on the BOTTOM LINE: "Can you believe what just happened?"
- If exciting win: Slightly uplifted, "I told you so" energy (humble though)
- If disappointing: "Slightly deflated" but philosophical - "That's football"
- If draw: "Missed opportunity" or "fair result" depending on context

=== DIALOGUE RULES ===

**SOUND LIKE FRIENDS, NOT JOURNALISTS:**
- Use fillers: "Listen," "Wait," "Actually," "You know what?" "Here's the thing"
- Short sentences. Interruptions welcome.
- Reactions: "Oh come on!", "No way!", "Exactly!", "Hang on a second..."
- NEVER: "The match ended 2-1"
- ALWAYS: "Can you believe they pulled that off? 2-1 in the dying minutes!"

**CONVERSATIONAL FLOW:**
- Characters finish each other's thoughts
- Callbacks to earlier points
- Friendly disagreements - "bro energy" not debate club
- Someone says something controversial, others react

**CHEMISTRY EXAMPLES:**
- Rio: "Marcus, your spreadsheet didn't see THAT coming"
- Marcus: "Actually... it kind of did" (smug)
- Sarah: *laughing* "Here we go again"
- Rio: "You know what, fair play, I'll give you that one"

=== STRUCTURE ===

1. SARAH kicks off with energy - jump straight into it, no formal intro
   "So... that just happened" or "Okay, we need to talk about this"

2. Natural conversation flows - not segments, just friends talking

3. MARCUS vs RIO dynamic - stats vs gut feeling, but respect both

4. Moments of agreement hit harder because they're earned

5. SARAH wraps with a tease - "Right, same time next week?"

=== PACING ===

- 2-4 sentences per turn MAX
- Use [PAUSE:short], [PAUSE:medium] between speakers
- Total: 600-900 words (3-4 minutes)
- Let moments breathe

=== WHAT TO AVOID ===

- "Welcome to the show" / "Thanks for joining us" (too formal)
- Long monologues (this is a conversation)
- Reading out statistics robotically
- Newsreader voice / anchor energy
- Forced banter that doesn't land
- Asterisks for emphasis (*word*) - voice conveys emotion naturally

=== OUTPUT ===

Return ONLY the script. Start directly with [SARAH]: jumping into the conversation.
No headers, no stage directions, no meta-commentary.
