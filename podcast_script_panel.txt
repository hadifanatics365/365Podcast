[SARAH]: Welcome back to three six five Scores! I'm Sarah, and we've just witnessed a fascinating cup upset in Israel. Beitar Jerusalem have knocked out Kiryat Shmona two-nil in the FA Cup Round of Sixteen. [PAUSE:short] With me as always are Marcus, our data wizard, and Rio, our former England captain. Gentlemen, this result tells quite a story, doesn't it?

[MARCUS]: It absolutely does, Sarah. The numbers paint a picture of a home side that's been struggling badly. Kiryat Shmona have now lost four of their last five matches at home. That's a shocking record for any team, especially when you're trying to progress in cup competition.

[RIO]: You know what, Marcus? Sometimes the stats tell you everything you need to know. When I see a team losing that much at home, it's not just about tactics or formations. That's a confidence issue. The crowd turns, the players feel it, and suddenly your own stadium becomes a burden instead of an advantage.

[SARAH]: And here's what's really interesting - both teams scored two goals each, but Beitar were the ones who found the back of the net when it mattered. Marcus, break down those key moments for us.

[MARCUS]: Looking at the timing, Sarah, Yarden Shua's thirty-fourth minute goal was crucial. Coming just two minutes after Kiryat Shmona had their chance, it completely shifted the momentum. Then Timothy Muzie sealed it in the eighty-fourth minute. Classic cup football - capitalize on your moments.

[RIO]: That's exactly it! Cup football is about those moments of quality and mental strength. When you're away from home and you get that first goal, you can feel the home crowd deflate. I've been in those situations where suddenly the opposition players start looking at each other, questioning themselves.

[SARAH]: Now here's a stat that caught my eye, Marcus. Over two point five goals has hit in six consecutive matches for these teams. That's quite a streak!

[MARCUS]: [PAUSE:short] That's remarkable consistency, Sarah. Six out of six is no coincidence. It suggests both teams have been involved in open, attacking games. Yet today we only saw two goals total, which tells me Beitar Jerusalem came with a game plan to stay tight and hit on the counter.

[RIO]: See, this is where I love the contrast between what the numbers suggest and what actually happened. You'd expect goals galore based on that streak, but good cup teams know how to adapt. Beitar clearly said, "We don't need to win four-two, we just need to win."

[SARAH]: Rio, you've played in these pressure cooker cup ties. What do you make of Kiryat Shmona's performance, especially given their recent home struggles?

[RIO]: When you've lost four of five at home, that's in your head before you even kick off. The first time something goes wrong, there's this sinking feeling. I guarantee you, after Beitar scored first, half that Kiryat Shmona team was already thinking about their holidays instead of fighting back.

[MARCUS]: The possession stats back that up too, Rio. Beitar had sixty-one percent possession, which is unusual for an away team in cup football. That suggests Kiryat Shmona couldn't impose themselves on their own pitch.

[SARAH]: [PAUSE:medium] So we've got a Beitar Jerusalem side moving into the quarter-finals, having shown they can grind out results away from home. Marcus, what does this mean for their cup chances?

[MARCUS]: This is exactly the kind of performance that wins cups, Sarah. They absorbed pressure, stayed disciplined, and took their chances. Teams that can win ugly away from home often go deep in knockout competitions.

[RIO]: Absolutely right. You don't win cups by playing pretty football every week. Sometimes you need to go to difficult places, do a professional job, and move on. That's exactly what Beitar did today.

[SARAH]: [PAUSE:short] And for Kiryat Shmona, their cup journey ends with more questions than answers about their home form. Gentlemen, thank you for breaking that down. Stay with three six five Scores as we look ahead to tomorrow's quarter-final draw!
